<p> Slightly more advanced lottery project, made with Solidity..</p>
<p>In this project I wanted to go a little further with data type handling, I made a project where all the smart contracts are connected in certain functions, it was a bit crazy and I left comments in certain functions to guide you and know what it really does .</p>
<p>I wanted to add the ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens in a project, and better handle security in certain functions.</p>
<p>I hope you can practice with this project, and add or customize anything you want.</p>

<h2>Prettier definition </h2>
<p> Prettier offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What <Prettier> offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.</p>
